# My_GLTFs
Files originally made from scratch for the creation of original videogame levels in Star Wars Battlefront II (2005).

Now I am converting them from .msh file format into .gltf file format using Blender and uploading them to Github in order to 
embed each asset directly in my website at smithmaps.art, creating an easily navigable gallery of my own original 3D art assets.
